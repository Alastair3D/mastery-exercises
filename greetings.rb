# Specification: a vague answer to the question, “What do you want this programme to do?”
#
# “I hate my mate Steve: so much so that my hatred spills over to anyone with a first name beginning with 'S'. I want a program that, when anyone types their name in, shouts at them if their name begins with an 'S'. Anyone else should just get a friendly greeting.”
#
# The process of breaking a specification down into requirements is known as algorithmic thinking.
#
# Here's the list of requirements for the specification above:
# •    The user sees a greeting, which asks them to enter their name.
# •    The user enters their name.
# •    If the user's name begins with 'S', the program shouts the user's name back at them.
# •    If the user's name begins with any other letter, the program just says 'Hi, ' plus their name.
