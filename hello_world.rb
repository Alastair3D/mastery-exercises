puts 1 + 1


# Option 1. Launch IRB, immediatley requiring this file using: irb -r ./hello_world.rb
# Option 2. Run the file directly using ruby ./hello_world.rb

# Describe the difference between the two?

# With 1, you get the return value of the program then an IRB prompt
# With 2, running the program directly from the command line, you get the same output but you don't go into the program world and the prompt is from the console, $.
